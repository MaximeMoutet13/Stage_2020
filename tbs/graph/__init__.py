"""Generic Graph module.

.. currentmodule:: tbs.graph


We assume that edges are subsets of `X`. In its
whole generality, one can just supposes that `E` is a set of two element
tuples. Such graph are said to be *directed*. That is if  `(x, y)` is an edge,
`(y, x)` is not necessarily one. It is possible to produce directed graphs in
:mod:`base` but most of the methods and functions handle only nondirected graphs.

    graph
        Given a set X, a *graph* G is a couple (X, E) where E is a set of two element subsets
        of X.

    graphs
        See :term:`graph`.

    vertex
        Given a graph G = (X, E), X is said to be the *vertices* of G.

    vertices

    edge
        Given a :term:`graph` G = (X, E), E is said to be the *edges* of G.

    edges

    directed graph
        Given a set `X`, a *graph* `G` is a couple (X, E) where E is a set of two element tuple
        of `X`.
